                        Since 2010, Novak Djokovic has followed a strict diet
                        cutting gluten, following consultation with nutritionist
                        Dr Igor Cetojevic. And today, we can clearly see the
                        results, as he is currently one of the most dominant
                        athletes in sport, covering the tennis court like a
                        robot. During the month of April 2020, Novak declared he
                        “was opposed to vaccination”, while also stating he was
                        “no expert”. He continued by saying that his issue was
                        that someone was forcing him to put something in his
                        body he .
